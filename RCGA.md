# Real Coded Genetic Algorithm for Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs)

### Learning objective:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Determine a connection matrix $\hat{E}$ given an input data $C_{(t)}$ at certain iteration interval $t \in \{ 0, ..., K\}$ such that the FCM minimizes the average error between the observed $C_{(t)}$ and the precited $\hat{C}_{t+1}$ values.
